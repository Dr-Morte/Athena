To run our program please navigate to the directory containing the Project2GUI.java and use the command "javac -cp /usr/java/jre1.8.0_131/lib/ext/:/usr/java/jre1.8.0_131/lib/ Project2GUI.java" to compile and then the command "java Project2GUI" to run. Make sure you have Xming running if you are on a windows machine using putty, and also make sure X11 forwarding is enabled in putty. From there the GUI will load and the instructions for the program will be present.
We also included the programs we used to train the neural net and get the resulting weights. They are NNRunner.java and NeuralNetwork.java.
